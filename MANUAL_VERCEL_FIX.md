# 🛠️ MANUAL VERCEL FIX REQUIRED

## Problem
Your Vercel account has **deployment protection enabled globally**, which blocks all API access. This is why you're getting "Đăng ký thất bại" (Registration failed).

## ✅ SOLUTION: Disable Deployment Protection

### Step 1: Disable Protection in Vercel Dashboard

1. **Go to your Vercel dashboard:** https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. **Select your backend project:** `backend-public` (or any backend project)
3. **Go to Settings → Deployment Protection**
4. **Turn OFF deployment protection** OR **add your frontend domain to bypass list**

### Step 2: Test the Backend

After disabling protection, test this URL in your browser:
```
https://backend-public-cinodfcg0-khanhs-projects-3f746af3.vercel.app/health
```

You should see a JSON response like:
```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "message": "Public API is running",
  "endpoints": {...}
}
```

### Step 3: Update Frontend (Already Done)

I've already updated your frontend to use the new backend:
- ✅ Created: `backend-public` project 
- ✅ Deployed to: `https://backend-public-cinodfcg0-khanhs-projects-3f746af3.vercel.app`

### Step 4: Deploy Updated Frontend

Once the backend is accessible, run:
```bash
cd frontend
vercel --prod
```

## 🎯 Expected Results After Fix

- ✅ Registration: "Đăng ký thành công!" (Registration successful)
- ✅ Login: "Đăng nhập thành công!" (Login successful)  
- ✅ No more "Endpoint not found" errors
- ✅ No more "Đăng ký thất bại" errors

## 🔍 Alternative: Use Environment Variable

If you prefer to keep protection enabled, you can:

1. **Set environment variable** in your frontend Vercel project:
   - Variable: `REACT_APP_API_URL`
   - Value: `https://backend-public-cinodfcg0-khanhs-projects-3f746af3.vercel.app/api`

2. **Add your frontend domain** to the backend's bypass list in Vercel dashboard

**The core issue is Vercel deployment protection blocking your API calls. Once disabled, your authentication system will work perfectly.**
